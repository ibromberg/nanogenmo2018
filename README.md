# nanogenmo2018
I really wanted to participate in NaNoGenMo this year!!! I don't know if I'll actually get something finished by the end of the month because #school but it will be a cool fun and productive side project to have!


TODO

- do output into a text file

- finish all the possible output templates

- add random "result" line to the end of each template; 'feed to target','sleep with results under pillow', etc.
